The data set that I am using shows the correlation between all NBA players and their game statistics in the 2020 - 2021 season. I chose to use the most important and common data shown which includes the player's team, the amount of games they played, games started, points, rebounds, assists, steals and turnovers in the 2020 - 2021 season. In the data, the players are ranked from first to last based on their total points during the season. 

I chose this data set because basketball is my favourite and only sport I watch on TV, and throughout my research, I found that there was a lot of data that could be used. Out of 30 different statistics that could be used in relation to the basketball player, I decided to use a few significant ones including their team, the amount of games they played, games started, points, rebounds, assists, steals and turnovers. I chose to focus on the most common statistics that might be heard for each player to keep my code and application more simple and straight to the point.
